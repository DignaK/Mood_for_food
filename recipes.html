        const ingrBreakfast2 = ["1 cup old-fashioned oats", "1 cup spinach", "1 ripe banana", "1 egg", 
        "1/2 cup milk of choice", "2 tablespoon oil", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",

        <h3>Instructions</h3> 
        <ol class="Instructions">            
            <li>In a blender, place the oats and pulse on medium speed for 30 seconds or until oats are a 
                chunky flour consistency. You will blend them all the way up in the next step, so the oats
                don’t have to be perfectly even right now.</li>
            <li>Add in the spinach, banana, egg, milk, oil, cinnamon and vanilla extract and blend on high 
                for 30-60 seconds or until batter is completely smooth and the spinach is completely broken 
                down, scraping down the sides of the blender if needed.</li>
            <li>Add in the baking powder and salt and blend on low for 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan or pancake griddle over medium to medium-low heat. Pour 1/4 cup of 
                batter onto the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes or until tiny bubbles appear on the outside 
                of the pancake. Flip and cook for an additional 2 minutes. If batter gets too thick, add 
                in a tablespoon at a time of milk and re-blend until you have the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Transfer pancakes to a cooling rack and repeat the process until you have used all of the batter.

            These are just a few suggestions on how I would serve this to my family. 
            You can serve it any way that works for your family. Also, have fun with 
            the toppings. Those are what taco night the best!
        </p>

     

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>            
        <p id="ingrDinner1"></p>
        
        <script>
        const ingrDinner1 = ["1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts", "1 cup salsa", 
        "2 tsp mild chili powder", "1/2 tsp sea salt", "1/2 tsp paprika", "1/4 tsp garlic powder", 
        "2 tbsp water"];
        text += "</ul>";
        document.getElementById("ingrDinner1").innerHTML = text;
        
        function myFunction(value) {
          text += "<li>" + value + "</li>";
        } 
        </script>



        <h3>Instructions</h3> 
        <ol class="Instructions">            
            <li>If using a thicker salsa (like the one pictured above) add in 2 tablespoons of water 
                to the instant pot. If you are using a thinner salsa, usually found in the produce 
                section of your grocery store, you can skip the added water.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken into the Instant Pot. If doubling the recipe, 
                make sure the chicken is in a simple layer at the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle on the chili powder, garlic powder, paprika and salt.</li>
            <li>Pour the salsa on top of the chicken. Do not mix.</li>
            <li>Place lid on the Instant Pot and lock it into place. Move the steam valve to the 
                seal position and manually set the Instant Pot to 10 minutes on high pressure. 
                Let naturally release for 5 minutes and then manually release the rest of the pressure</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board using 2 forks, shred into bite-size pieces. 
                This is a great time to keep in chicken separate for baby or toddler that doesn't 
                like as much flavor.</li>
            <li>Transfer the salsa liquid to another bowl or measuring cup – don't worry we will 
                add it back in.</li>
            <li>Place the shredded chicken back into the instant pot, adding back the salsa liquid a 
                little at a time until you get the right chicken to salsa ration. Depending 
                on how much water is in the chicken, I usually use half of the salsa.</li>
