            These are just a few suggestions on how I would serve this to my family. 
            You can serve it any way that works for your family. Also, have fun with 
            the toppings. Those are what taco night the best!
        </p>

     

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>            
        <p id="ingrDinner1"></p>
        
        <script>
        const ingrDinner1 = ["1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts", "1 cup salsa", 
        "2 tsp mild chili powder", "1/2 tsp sea salt", "1/2 tsp paprika", "1/4 tsp garlic powder", 
        "2 tbsp water"];
        text += "</ul>";
        document.getElementById("ingrDinner1").innerHTML = text;
        
        function myFunction(value) {
          text += "<li>" + value + "</li>";
        } 
        </script>



        <h3>Instructions</h3> 
        <ol class="Instructions">            
            <li>If using a thicker salsa (like the one pictured above) add in 2 tablespoons of water 
                to the instant pot. If you are using a thinner salsa, usually found in the produce 
                section of your grocery store, you can skip the added water.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken into the Instant Pot. If doubling the recipe, 
                make sure the chicken is in a simple layer at the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle on the chili powder, garlic powder, paprika and salt.</li>
            <li>Pour the salsa on top of the chicken. Do not mix.</li>
            <li>Place lid on the Instant Pot and lock it into place. Move the steam valve to the 
                seal position and manually set the Instant Pot to 10 minutes on high pressure. 
                Let naturally release for 5 minutes and then manually release the rest of the pressure</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board using 2 forks, shred into bite-size pieces. 
                This is a great time to keep in chicken separate for baby or toddler that doesn't 
                like as much flavor.</li>
            <li>Transfer the salsa liquid to another bowl or measuring cup – don't worry we will 
                add it back in.</li>
            <li>Place the shredded chicken back into the instant pot, adding back the salsa liquid a 
                little at a time until you get the right chicken to salsa ration. Depending 
                on how much water is in the chicken, I usually use half of the salsa.</li>
